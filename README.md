# RentHopProject

For my machine learning class, a group of friends and I used data analytics to predict how many inquiries would a post on RentHop get. 

We used https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries to get our data.

I recommend reading "RentHop Inquiry Rate Model Team7 Final.pdf" for more info.
